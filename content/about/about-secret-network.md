###### What is Secret Network?

#### A <span>blockchain-based</span>, <span>open-source protocol</span> that lets anyone perform computations on encrypted data, bringing <span>privacy to smart contracts</span> and <span>public blockchains</span>.

By supporting encrypted inputs, encrypted outputs, and encrypted state for smart contracts, Secret Network allows for new kinds of powerful decentralized applications to be built. This can unlock substantial value across multiple verticals and industries, including the following:

### How Secret Network Operates

The Secret Network is a decentralized network of computers (secret nodes) that utilize trusted execution environments (TEEs) to enable secure, private computation over encrypted data. TEEs function like a “black box” for data processing, and they are utilized in all types of everyday platforms such as smartphones and video game consoles.

The Secret Network blockchain is based on Cosmos SDK / Tendermint, meaning the network has its own independent consensus, on-chain governance, and features like slashing and delegation. It is secured by the native coin Secret (SCRT), which must be staked by network validators and is used for transaction fees as well as governance.

Secret Apps - powered by “secret”, privacy-preserving smart contracts - are built with CosmWasm smart contracts that are written in the Rust programming language and deployed on the Secret Network.

### Network Flow

The following process describes, step by step, how a contract is submitted and a computation performed on the Secret Network:

#### 01
#### Writing

A developer writes "secret" smart contracts and deploys them to the Secret Network.

#### 02
#### Submission

Users submit encrypted data to Secret Network that can’t be read by anyone else — including the node doing the computation.

<card-minimal class="accent-yellow icon-next">

#### 03
#### Computation

A "secret node" in the network performs the computation, and returns the result.

#### 04
#### Verification

The work is verified as correct, and payment is released to the secret node that performed the work.
